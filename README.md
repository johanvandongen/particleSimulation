# particleSimulation
In this simulation there is a grid of cells. Every x seconds the grid gets updated to a new state, and for that update every cell will follow some specific rule set according to their particle type. Every particle determines its next move according to its 8 neighbours. Sand for example will always move down if the particle beneath it is empty. This also goes under the name of cellular automata if im not mistaken.
